                        A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model, or DOM, that represents the loaded web page. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using Ajax technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using Ajax technologies the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server.

                        DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.

                        Graphic design is art with a purpose. It involves a creative and systematic plan to solve a problem or achieve certain objectives, with the use of images, symbols or even words. It is visual communication and the aesthetic expression of concepts and ideas using various graphic elements and tools.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Graphic design can use image-based designs involving photos, illustrations, logos and symbols, type-based designs, or a combination of both techniques. These designs can include various combinations of the following elements.

                <h3>FLASH DESIGN</h3>
                <div class='col-md-7'>
                    <p>
                        We publish files using flash animation. This software is generally used in web media, television and in web sites designing. Interactive designs made by us are only with the help of popular softwareâ€™s. Use of animation, increases the sales and gives a better picture in the clientâ€™s mind.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Adobe Flash used to be one of the most widely available technologies used on the web. For developers, the ability to program one multimedia presentation that could be viewed the same on nearly all computers made the technology very appealing. However, technology has quickly shifted away from using Flash to other technologies, such as HTML5. For individuals with disabilities, Flash always introduced unique accessibility problems, many of which are adequately addressed by HTML5 and other web technologies.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Because of the multimedia nature of Flash, it can be used to deliver content through many mediums: graphics, text, video, audio, etc. Its power and flexibility give it potential to present web content in unique, and potentially accessible, ways.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite the ability of Flash to create (at least marginally) accessible content, there are some major issues you must be aware of regarding Flash and accessibility. Nearly all of the concepts that affect HTML accessibility can also apply to Flash. These include providing plenty of contrast, consistent navigation, understandable language, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By its very nature, Flash content does not lend itself to screen reader accessibility. Flash content is time-based and often changes over time. HTML content is more or less static. The static nature of HTML allows a screen reader to access the HTML content in a linear fashion. When a visual user accesses a Flash movie, he or she visually scans the contents of the movie and focuses directly on the important content or functionality. A screen reader user cannot "scan" through Flash content and can only access it in a linear manner and in the order the Flash developer has chosen to present it. Flash's timeline and programming language (Action Script) allow constantly changing, dynamic, updating objects to animate, move, disappear, or duplicate themselves whenever the Flash developer chooses (or even randomly if they want). Because Flash content is usually constantly changing, this limits the ability of the screen reader to read the content in a sufficient or timely manner
