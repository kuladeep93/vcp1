                        If your theme supports Featured Content, you can activate the Featured Content area by navigating to Appearance → Customize and entering the name of a tag into the “Tag name” field in the “Featured Content” section.

                        The separation of style from content has become the bugbear of the HTML developer. Traditionally, we’ve used well-written CSS and XHTML to achieve this separation, and we’ve seen how much easier it is to update our sites or provide multiple styles when we write our markup this way. By adding some very basic PHP to this mix, we can take this modularity a step further, making it easier not only to update our styling, but our structure as well. In essence, we can create our own basic Content Management System.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PHP is an open-source server-side language. In order to use PHP, you will need the PHP module installed on your server. Most Linux servers have this module installed, and the PHP module is also available for Microsoft servers. If you are unsure about your server or modules, just ask your web host.

                        Essentially, the master template will use XHTML for structural markup, CSS for style, and some basic PHP to manage it all. Some very basic work with PHP variables will give us multiple style sheets, and will allow us to display different content documents within the same template. Since PHP is a server-side language, all the fancy work is done at the server, before the browser ever gets a peek, so this approach makes cross-browser support much easier to achieve
